<p>Do I expect fan fiction? No. Am I going to preemptively allow and appreciate it, regardless? Yes. I have better things to worry about than stamping approval on work that while, yes, you may have my characters in, it is still <em>your</em> work. Hell, your ideas may be better than mine.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#conflicts" id="conflicts">Conflicts</a></h1>
<p>The world is recovering from a world war. It has lead to change of powers as countries start seeking to unionize in order share in trade and policies. One of them was a once cat exclusive nation, the Bradford Kingdom, located on the island of Nethington, opening their doors to outsiders. As a consequence, the capital changed from a once dominant cat city, Catsinburg, to a new multi-species city, Furtropolis. While many welcomed the change, there is still some unrest by those yearning the old days.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#great-war" id="great-war">Great War</a></h2>
<p>The Great War was a world war that lasted for five wars. It lead to a large shift in the balance of power and towards democracy while many nations formed unions in order to share economic and political benefits that they once fought over before the Great War. It has lead to technical advances and break through.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is satisfied with the outcome. Some people, including newly elected leaders of nations, wish to go back to the days before the Great War, despite the majority liking the results.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#nethington" id="nethington">Nethington</a></h1>
<p>Nethington is a island nation located on the north pacific ocean. It is ruled by the Bradford kingdom, a large and powerful kingdom founded by cats.

<h3><a class="header" href="#sports" id="sports">Sports</a></h3>
<p>Nethington has varies kinds of sports. The most notable being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union">Rugby</a>. Since Furtropolis' rise, the country sometimes hosts a underwater version of the sport, consisting of varies (semi-)aquatic creatures. With the rise in ever increasingly powerful computers, eSports has seen an emergence that has further been aided by VR.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fashion" id="fashion">Fashion</a></h3>
<p>With the exception of hairless animals, the majority of furries don't wear clothing that completely covers their body as it would irritate their fur. This means that shorter or medieval-style clothing remain the norm, despite taking place in modern to contemporary times.</p>

<li>Men's bottoms may consist of loincloths, kilts or shorts.</li>
<li>Women don't need to wear pants.</li>
<li>Both Genders:

<li>Tunics.</li>
<li>Short or Sleeveless tops.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="country/../img/furtropolis.png" alt="Furtropolis map" /></p>
<p>Furtropolis is the capital city of Nethington that took Catsinburg's place at the end of the Great War. The city center is home to many political buildings, such as parliament, though the Bradford castle is located elsewhere.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#economy" id="economy">Economy</a></h2>
<p>Furtropolis is home to a diverse range of species, both organic and synthetic alike, though it doesn't necessarily specialize in any one particular thing for one particular species, compared to it's predecessor, Catsinburg, but provide a healthy mix for all instead while it primarily serves as a international trading hub, due to it's ports to the ocean.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#locations" id="locations">Locations</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#central-tower" id="central-tower">Central Tower</a></h3>
<p>Consisting of Town Hall and Mayor's House, the Central Tower sits within the city center, near parliament, museum, and historical monuments. Being the hub of the city's local politics, it also serves as the terminal for the Furtropolis subway network with shuttles to and from Grand Central Terminal.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#grand-central-terminal" id="grand-central-terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a></h3>
<p>Grand Central Terminal is a railroad terminal that connects regional and long distance trains between Furtropolis and other parts of Nethington. It has transfers to the city's bus and subway network, respectfully. Some long distance trains pass under the subway with some tunnels having maintenance stairways to the above network.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#north-pacific-ports" id="north-pacific-ports">North Pacific Ports</a></h3>
<p>The North Pacific Ports sees frequent trade from cargo ships and is a major cruise ship destination for tourists wishing to the view city during the summer. Cruise ships dock and sail out from Furtropolis during the winter.

<h1><a class="header" href="#catsinburg" id="catsinburg">Catsinburg</a></h1>
<p>Catsinburg is the former capital city of Nethington, having been replaced by Furtropolis. The city was created during the Bradford kingdom's formation, and is located more inland compared to it's successor. It fell out of favor following the end of the Great War, when the country ended it's isolationist rule, and more emphases on international trade as the war greatly depleted their resources.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#economy-1" id="economy-1">Economy</a></h2>
<p>The city is not nearly as diverse as it's successor, consisting only of varies feline species and breeds. Despite this set back, it used this to it's advantage and specialized in feline-oriented goods and services from which Furtropolis frequently imports from.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#ashelor" id="ashelor">Ashelor</a></h1>
<p>Located off the coast of Furtropolis, near the North Pacific Ports, is Ashelor, an underwater city home to varies aquatic creatures. Like it's neighbor, Ashelor is best known for it's international trade and tourism as well as sharing a similar economy.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#architecture" id="architecture">Architecture</a></h2>
<p>Ashelor is unique to those on land because it's architecture remains in the space-age (think Jetsons) with a larger and open design. This is because aquatic creatures can freely swim vertically. Despite similarities, Ashelor's designs predate the trend and are functionality different. However, the trend did help lead to it's modern design.</p>

With <em>ami</em> and <em>kipo</em> behaving as root words that mean &quot;female&quot; and &quot;male&quot;, respectfully.</p>
<p>The closet equivalent, without being blunt, is Gynomorphs and Andromorphs, but the these words don't do Casey Universe justice because they literally mean mimicking characteristics of respective opposite sex. Wherein amitoju and kipomito specially refers to the having the physical reproductive traits of the opposite sex, born or surgical. These words are especially useful for Synths, due to their modular nature.</p>

<p>Synths treat their <a href="https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Modules">modules</a> the same way organics treat clothes.

He is best known for wearing a partial mask, based on Synth technology, that has two LED faceplates for his eyes and muzzle.</p>
<p>Robin is often used as a scapegoat by politicians seeking to return to the days of isolation. He openly admits to wishing he didn't have to resort to stealing to help those in need, and would prefer the wealthy just pay their fair share of taxes. </p>
<p>Robin has no affiliation with Bark Pack, only working behind the shadows when they have the spotlight, but he does sometimes aid them with the help of his own group when their goals overlap.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#zack-casey" id="zack-casey">Zack Casey</a></h2>

<p>He believes in doing good and the freedom to do good, but has a healthy, if somewhat grudging, respect for lawful methods. Zack thinks the world should be free and good as they see fit, but understands the rest of the world is more complicated than that. He tries to be vigilant against being too judgmental over lawful matters, but is not immune.</p>
<p>Zack's slightly more chaotic nature means that, despite his efforts being well-intended, he is more likely to get himself thrown in jail or anger the natives during times of conflict or tension. This often forces Anthony and/or Felix to have to bail him out or save him. He also has a mad crush on Robin whom also inspired him to form Bark Pack.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#prince-oliver-bradford" id="prince-oliver-bradford">Prince Oliver Bradford</a></h2>
<p>Oliver is a tabby cat with blue fur. Despite his &quot;Prince&quot; title, he is not in the top five list of successors to become king as he is one of many grandchildren in the royal family. </p>
<p>But he has no interest in becoming king, anyway, and works to keep his prince status discrete, often to the disappointment of his parents. Because of this refuel, he often wonders about the kingdom, often untended, to see what it's like on the outside and is more likely to question the laws, if they see them doing more harm than good. However, he will still use his status as royalty as means of last resort.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#felix-casey" id="felix-casey">Felix Casey</a></h2>
<p>Felix is a purple Synth who works as a construction worker for Furtropolis. He likes to switch between male and kipomito between upgrades, lives with the Casey brothers, and has a <a href="https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Helperbots">helperbot</a>, Nix, that serves as his companion.</p>
<p>Like all Synths, Felix desires to be helpful, and naturally takes a more structured approach to life. As a consequence, he has a hard time living outside of a rule set. He feels more guilt in bending or breaking the rules, even when he knows it's the right thing to do. However, his familiarity with the rules makes him more pragmatic at times. He frequently has to give the Casey brothers a reality check, often to their own frustration.</p>

<p>Savelli Cornell is a male Dalmatian who works for the Bradford kingdom's guard and is loyal to the royal family after learning from his parents. His parents were refugees who worked their way up by doing the same. He works within the laws and uses his close ties royalty to get what he wants.</p>
<p>Being so close royalty meant Savelli grew up with Prince Oliver. Oliver was one of the rare few in the royal family that saw him as a friend, not a servant, and two befriended each other. He is one of the few to ever see Savelli smile.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#past-universes" id="past-universes">Past Universes</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fbdj" id="fbdj">FBDJ</a></h3>
<p>The FBDJ Universe is the true original universe. At this point, there was <em>only</em> Zack Casey living along the outskirts of what is now Catsinburg, however there was no kingdom. He did have a neighbor that was simply named John. They all lived within in a housing development. Zack was blue a fox that aspired to be a DJ, known as the <strong>F</strong>urry <strong>B</strong>lue <strong>DJ</strong>. Later timelines introduced a proto version of Saveli Cornell and his android assistant as an early antagonist whom was more a parody of comic villains.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#proto" id="proto">Proto</a></h3>
<p>The Proto Universe was the first to carry the Casey Universe title, but there was no kingdom and Zack Casey now lived alone in what is now Furtropolis until he met Aidan Cheddar.</p>
<p>Furtropolis was one of many small city-states out in the middle of a barren desert. It had giant, tall and thick walls in order to block any dust storms and protect against any attacks. The Central Tower had Grand Central Terminal beneath it in order to save on space and provided extra stability for the tower above. Mice lived under and helped maintained the subway network below.</p>
<p>Saveli Cornell would go to overthrow Furtropolis which started a civil war. Zack Casey and Aidan Cheddar would try to defeat him the first time around but were instantly kicked out. They try again by traveling the continent, where they met Kit Welsh whom teamed up with them, and oceans for a year until they could come back around through the docks, ready and prepared.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#bark-pack-1" id="bark-pack-1">Bark Pack</a></h3>
<p>A re-imagining of both the FBDJ and Proto Universes that merged them together. It kept Furtropolis while keeping the main characters along the outskirts. Main locations varied from a small town to a university. Meanwhile, Bark Pack threw out the Savelli Cornell plot and focused on slice-of-life. Furtropolis was located in a fictional state within the USA, as oppose to an fictional island nation.</p>
<p>However, later iterations would introduce a new villain, Silverclaw, and begin experimenting with more fantastical elements with the Odium crystals, inspired by the Infinity Stones, that Silverclaw wants. Bark Pack also introduced Felix and Tom, both university students. Felix's family owned the university but didn't like that fact and hated being the center of attention. Meanwhile, Tom was a average student dealing with the social troubles of being a kipomito - they were only recently introduced in later iterations of Bark Pack.</p>

    exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications

    Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
    doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
    recipient of the Licensed Material.

    or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
    are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
    with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the
    Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided

    under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or
    other similar personality rights; however, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
    such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
    to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

    License.

3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
    royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights,
