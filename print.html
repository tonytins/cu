<p>The world is recovering from a world war. It has lead to change of powers as countries start seeking to unionize in order share in trade and policies. One of them was a once cat exclusive nation, the Bradford Kingdom, located on the island continent of Odin, opening their doors to outsiders. As a consequence, the capital changed from a once dominant cat city, Catsinburg, to a new multi-species city, Furtropolis. While many welcomed the change, there is still some unrest by those yearning the old days.</p>

<p>While a <a href="https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page">lore</a> does exist, it serves only as a means to flesh out the species and <em>does not need to be strictly followed</em>. Though for the purposes of this book, Synths based on that lore will go under the &quot;mainline&quot; title. As a species, CU versions of Synths can be considered a subset of the mainline as the differences are currently subtle.</p>

<p>The closet equivalent, without being blunt, is Gynomorphs and Andromorphs, but the these words don't do Casey Universe justice because they literally mean mimicking characteristics of respective opposite sex. Wherein amitoju and kipomito specially refers to the having the physical reproductive traits of the opposite sex, born or surgical. These words are especially useful for Synths, due to their modular nature.</p>

<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and
certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Considerations for licensors:</strong> Our public licenses are intended
for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use
material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other
rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose
before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse
the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material
not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed
material, or material used under an exception or limitation to
copyright. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors">More considerations for
licensors</a>.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Considerations for the public:</strong> By using one of our public
licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have
copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged
to respect those requests where reasonable. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees">More considerations for

<p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed
Material available under these terms and conditions.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-1----definitions" id="section-1----definitions">Section 1 -- Definitions.</a></h2>
<p>a.  <strong>Adapted Material</strong> means material subject to Copyright and Similar
Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and
in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,
transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission
under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For

<p>c.  <strong>Copyright and Similar Rights</strong> means copyright and/or similar
rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>d.  <strong>Effective Technological Measures</strong> means those measures that, in
the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
agreements.</p>

any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.</p>
<p>f.  <strong>Licensed Material</strong> means the artistic or literary work, database,
or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.</p>
<p>g.  <strong>Licensed Rights</strong> means the rights granted to You subject to the
terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.</p>
<p>h.  <strong>Licensor</strong> means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.</p>
<p>i.  <strong>Share</strong> means to provide material to the public by any means or
process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as
reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
available to the public including in ways that members of the public
may access the material from a place and at a time individually
chosen by them.</p>
<p>j.  <strong>Sui Generis Database Rights</strong> means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

<p>k.  <strong>You</strong> means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed
Rights under this Public License. <strong>Your</strong> has a corresponding
meaning.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-2----scope" id="section-2----scope">Section 2 -- Scope.</a></h2>
<p>a.  <em><strong>License grant.</strong></em></p>
<pre><code>1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
    exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in
    part; and

    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2.  **Exceptions and Limitations.** For the avoidance of doubt,
    where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
    License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
    terms and conditions.

3.  **Term.** The term of this Public License is specified in
    Section 6(a).

4.  **Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.** The
    Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all
    media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to
    make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor
    waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
    forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to
    exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications
    necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For
    purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications
    authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
    Material.

5.  **Downstream recipients.**

    A. **Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material.** Every
    recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an
    offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under
    the terms and conditions of this Public License.

    B. **No downstream restrictions.** You may not offer or impose
    any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
    Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
    doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
    recipient of the Licensed Material.

6.  **No endorsement.** Nothing in this Public License constitutes
    or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
    are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
    with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the
    Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided
    in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
</code></pre>
<p>b.  <em><strong>Other rights.</strong></em></p>
<pre><code>1.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
    under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or
    other similar personality rights; however, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
    such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
    to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
    License.

3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
    royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights,
    whether directly or through a collecting society under any
    voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.
    In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to
    collect such royalties.
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-3----license-conditions" id="section-3----license-conditions">Section 3 -- License Conditions.</a></h2>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.</p>
<p>a.  <em><strong>Attribution.</strong></em></p>
<pre><code>1.  If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
    You must:

    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with
    the Licensed Material:

    i.  identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material
        and any others designated to receive attribution, in any
        reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by
        pseudonym if designated);

    ii. a copyright notice;

    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

    v.  a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
        reasonably practicable;

    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
    indication of any previous modifications; and

    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
    License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
    this Public License.

2.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
    reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
    which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
    reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
    hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3.  If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
    information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
    reasonably practicable.

4.  If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License
    You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material
    from complying with this Public License.
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-4----sui-generis-database-rights" id="section-4----sui-generis-database-rights">Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</a></h2>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<p>a.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
the contents of the database;</p>
<p>b.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then
the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not
its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</p>
<p>c.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all
or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-5----disclaimer-of-warranties-and-limitation-of-liability" id="section-5----disclaimer-of-warranties-and-limitation-of-liability">Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</a></h2>
<p>a.  <strong>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties
of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.</strong></p>
<p>b.  <strong>To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs,
expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of
the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
limitation may not apply to You.</strong></p>
<p>c.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-6----term-and-termination" id="section-6----term-and-termination">Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</a></h2>
<p>a.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
terminate automatically.</p>
<p>b.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<pre><code>1.  automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it
    is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

2.  upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of
this Public License.
</code></pre>
<p>c.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate
this Public License.</p>
<p>d.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-7----other-terms-and-conditions" id="section-7----other-terms-and-conditions">Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</a></h2>
<p>a.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>
<p>b.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#section-8----interpretation" id="section-8----interpretation">Section 8 -- Interpretation.</a></h2>
<p>a.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions
on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made
without permission under this Public License.</p>
<p>b.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
conditions.</p>
<p>c.  No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.</p>
<p>d.  Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as
a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of
any jurisdiction or authority.</p>
