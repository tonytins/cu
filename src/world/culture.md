# Culture

Though culture naturally differs from region-to-region, somethings remain constant throughout all societies in Casey Universe, especially since the internet's rise.

## Mythology

Within the Bradford kingdom's folklore, Idó is a word in Akina that describes the concept in which spirits that can range from elements of the landscape, forces of nature, as well as beings and the qualities that these beings express; they can also be the spirits of venerated dead people.

*In reality, Idó is adopted from the Japanese concept of [Kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami). While "Kami" normally translates to "Gods," the concept itself is much more involved.*
## Fashion

With the exception of hairless animals, the majority of furries don't wear clothing that completely covers their top and bottoms as it would irritate their fur.

### Differences

- Sleeveless shirts and vests replaces t-shirts and sweaters, respectively. 
- Men's bottoms consist of loincloths or shorts. 
- Women's bottoms haven't changed with the exception of no interest in pants.
