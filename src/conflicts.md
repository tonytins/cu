# Conflicts

The world is recovering from a world war. It has lead to change of powers as countries start seeking to unionize in order share in trade and policies. One of them was a once cat exclusive nation, the Bradford Kingdom, located on the island of Nethington, opening their doors to outsiders. As a consequence, the capital changed from a once dominant cat city, Catsinburg, to a new multi-species city, Furtropolis. While many welcomed the change, there is still some unrest by those yearning the old days.

## Great War

The Great War was a world war that lasted for five wars. It lead to a large shift in the balance of power and towards democracy while many nations formed unions in order to share economic and political benefits that they once fought over before the Great War. It has lead to technical advances and break through.

However, not everyone is satisfied with the outcome. Some people, including newly elected leaders of nations, wish to go back to the days before the Great War, despite the majority liking the results.
