Etrium, also known as Essence, is the central element of all magic that all other magical elements are based on.

The Book of Essence contains all knowledge of every magical element from the most common to the rarest. It gives the reader info on each magical element's properties and how to use them in spells, charms and alchemy. No one will ever know more than the Book of Essence.

However, nearly all copies were destroyed and only one remains. But it was lost centuries ago in a now abandoned ruin far away, never to be seen or heard of again. Until rumors of it's existence and possible location began to spread, though no one knows where it truly is.

But that hasn't stopped one mage who is on a long, potentially endless, quest to find the Book of Essence. They can sense it with their magic. To discover the book will take them on a long but exciting adventure around the world and across vast oceans to different nations, regions, and realms. All while meeting new people, places, cultures, plus spells, potions, and methods of using the many elements of Essence.
