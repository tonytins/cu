# CU-236, World of Magic

Etrium, also known as Essence, is the central element of all magic that all other magical elements are based on.

The Book of Essence contains all knowledge of every magical element from the most common to the rarest. It gives the reader info on each magical element's properties and how to use them in spells, charms and alchemy. No one will ever know more than the Book of Essence.

However, nearly all copies were destroyed. Now only one exists. But it was lost a centuries ago in a now abandoned ruin. Rumors of it's possible location exist, but no one knows where it truly is.

But that hasn't stopped one mage who is on a long, potentially endless, journey to find the Book of Essence. But they don't know where it is but know it exists somewhere on earth. They can sense it with their magic.

But to discover the book will take them on a long but exciting guest around the world to different nations and realms, across vast oceans and regions. All while meeting new people, places, cultures, plus spells, potions, and methods of using the many elements of Essence.
