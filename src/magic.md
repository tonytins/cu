# Magic

While not properly integrated into the primary universe yet, magic as it exists in [CU-236](./../multiverse/cu236.md) is elemental. Nearly all magic has it's own respective element or made up of other magical elements, as is common with alchemy, with Etrium as the central element. However, the more powerful a magical element is, the more unstable it becomes and the rarer it will be.

## List

| Element  | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Etrium   | Central element of all magic |
| Bluerium | Magic you're born with       |

## Etrium

Etrium, also known as Essence, is the central element of all magic that all other magical elements are based on.

## Bluerium

Bluerium is a magical element that you're born with. These beings are known as Mages. Bluerium is used for casting charms and spells which can be channeled through wands or staffs. Bluerium flows through a mage's body like blood, but it doesn't replace blood, and is capable of regenerating. It's passed down through heredity, but may become dormant if passed down to anyone born without it; however, it will eventually resurface unexpectedly in later generations. Bluerium can absorbed and it can temporarily be taken away.
