# Magic

While not properly integrated into the primary universe yet, magic as it exists in [CU-236](./../multiverse/cu236.md) is elemental. Nearly all magic has it's own respective element or made up of other magical elements, as is common with alchemy, with Etrium as the central element. However, the more powerful a magical element is, the more unstable it becomes and the rarer it will be.

## Etrium

Etrium, also known as Essence, is the central element of all magic that all other magical elements are based on.

## Bluerium

Bluerium is an magical element that you're born with and is used for casting charms and spells. These people are known as Mages. Bluerium flows through a mage's body like blood, but it does not replace blood. Mages use wands and staffs to help channel their magic.
