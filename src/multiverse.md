There was no kingdom, island of any kind and Anthony wasn't Zack's brother, nor did he exist at that point. Furtropolis was one of many small city-states out in the middle of a barren desert. It had giant, tall and thick walls in order to block any dust storms and protect against any attacks. The Central Tower had Grand Central Terminal beneath it in order to save on space and provided extra stability for the tower above. Mice lived under and helped maintained the subway network below.

Saveli Cornell would go to overthrow Furtropolis which started a civil war. Zack Casey and Aidan Cheddar would try to defeat him the first time around but were instantly kicked out. They try again by traveling the continent and oceans for a year until they could come back around through the docks, ready and prepared.
