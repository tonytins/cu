# Robert "Robin" Grayson

Robert Grayson is an fox with gray fur. Known under the alias "Robin," he is a legendary outlaw within the Bradford kingdom, who finds elaborate ways of stealing money from ultra wealthy CEOs and politicians, alike, in order to give back to the poor. He is best known for wearing a partial mask, based on Synth technology, that has two LED faceplates for his eyes and muzzle.

Robin is often used as a scapegoat by politicians seeking to return to the days of isolation. He openly admits to wishing he didn't have to resort to stealing to help those in need, and would prefer the wealthy just pay their fair share of taxes. 

Robin has no affiliation with Bark Pack, only working behind the shadows when they have the spotlight, but he does sometimes aid them with the help of his own group when their goals overlap.
