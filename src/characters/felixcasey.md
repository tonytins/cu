# Felix Casey

Felix is a purple Synth who works as a construction worker for Furtropolis. He likes to switch between male and kipomito between upgrades, lives with the Casey brothers, and has a [helperbot](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Helperbots), Nix, that serves as his companion.

Like all Synths, Felix desires to be helpful, and naturally takes a more structured approach to life. As a consequence, he has a hard time living outside of a rule set. He feels more guilt in bending or breaking the rules, even when he knows it's the right thing to do. However, his familiarity with the rules makes him more pragmatic at times. He frequently has to give the Casey brothers a reality check, often to their own frustration.
