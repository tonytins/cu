# Chaotic Characters

## Robert "Robin" Grayson

Robert Grayson is an fox with gray fur. Known under the alias "Robin," he is a legendary outlaw within the Bradford kingdom, that finds elaborate ways of stealing money from ultra wealthy CEOs and politicians, alike, in order to give back to the poor. He is best known for wearing a partial mask, based on Synth technology, that has two LED faceplate for his eyes and nuzzle.

Robin is often used as an escape goat by politicians seeking to return to the days of isolation. Even though he openly admits of wishing that he didn't have to resort to stealing just to help those in need and wishes the wealthy would pay their taxes.

Robin has no affiliation with Bark Pack, only working behind the shadows when they have the spotlight, but he does sometimes aid them with the help of his own group when their goals overlap.

## Zack Casey

Zack is a fennec with blue fur. His name has been past down from generations to generations but his friends just call him "Z". He is the founder of Bark Pack. 

He believes in doing good and the freedom to do good, but has a healthy, if somewhat grudging, respect for lawful methods. Zack thinks the world should be free and good as they see fit, but understands the rest of the world is more complicated than that. He tries to be vigilant against being too judgmental over lawful matters, but is not immune.

Zack's slightly more chaotic nature means that, despite his efforts being well-intended, he is more likely to get himself thrown in jail or anger the natives during times of conflict or tension. This often forces Anthony and/or Felix to have to bail him out or save him. He also has a mad crush on Robin whom also inspired him to form Bark Pack.
