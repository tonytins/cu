# Introduction

Casey Universe, or simply "CU," is my fictional universe that's open and free to use for anyone to participate or adapt. The canon is just guidelines both for myself and everyone. The multiverse can be used for creating unofficial variants.

Do I expect fan fiction? No. Am I going to preemptively allow and appreciate it, regardless? Yes. I have better things to worry about than stamping approval on work that while, yes, you may have my characters in, it is still *your* work. Hell, your ideas may be better than mine.
