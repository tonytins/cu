# Fashion

Though fashion differs from region to region, let alone species, somethings in Casey Universe remain consistent throughout the world. With the exception of hairless animals, the majority of furries don't wear clothing that completely covers their body as it would irritate their fur. This means that shorter or medieval-style clothing, such as tunics, remain the norm, despite taking place in modern to contemporary times.

## Differences

- Sleeveless shirts and vests replaces t-shirts and sweaters, respectively.
- Men's bottoms consist of loincloths or shorts.
- Women's fashion hasn't changed with only a few exceptions:
  - No interest in pants.
  - Dresses are sleeveless like shirts.

But full body clothing have not completely gone away. They're still used on rare or less common occasions, such as when protection outweighs comfort. E.g. construction, hazard areas, certain contact sports and weather.
