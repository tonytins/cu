## Ido

Within the Bradford kingdom's folklore, Ido is a word in Akina that describes the concept in which spirits that can range from elements of the landscape, forces of nature, as well as beings and the qualities that these beings express; they can also be the spirits of venerated dead people.

*In reality, Ido is adopted from the Japanese concept of [Kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami). While "Kami" normally translates to "Gods," the concept itself is much more involved.*
