# Bark Pack

Founded by Zack Casey, Bark Pack is a heroic team consisting of The Casey family:

* Zack
* Anthony
* Felix

Anthony directs the team, Zack helps with offense, and Felix provides defense.

## Additional Support

Robin occasionally joins in if their goals overlap, but otherwise has no affiliation as he has a team to care of. Prince Oliver frequently participates, as he often questions the kingdom's laws, but his role as royalty limits his availability.
