[Synths](https://synthspecies.com/) are a fictional synthetic android species created by [Vader-San](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/vader-san). They are open, free to use, and can be adapted into any canon without restrictions.

While a [lore](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Main_Page) does exist, it serves only as a means to flesh out the species and *does not need to be strictly followed*. Though for the purposes of this book, Synths based on that lore will go under the "mainline" title. As a species, CU versions of Synths can be considered a subset of the mainline as the differs only in culture.

## Culture

### Fashion

Synths treat their [modules](https://synthspecies.com/wiki/Modules) the same way organics treat clothes. For example, changing modules in public carries the same stigma as doing the same thing with clothes. However, Synths will wear clothes as a means of being polite or fitting with society. It's just seen as something more of cosmetic than anything necessary.
### Currency

Known as Volts, Synths use [watch batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_cell) as a form currency because of their usage in powering a computer's real-time clocks lasts for decades, making them them very valuable when not in use. The value of each battery is represents is based on the battery's total maximum volt.
