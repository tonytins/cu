# Language

The language of Nethington is [Akina](https://akina.tonybark.com/), meaning "spoken word". It's more commonly known as Nethingtish in-universe. Akina has it's own book, separate from this which goes over the specifications. This section, and certain parts of this book, cover the words and basic functions of the language. This is crucial in topics, such as [genetics](./../genetics.md), where a new word became mandatory because English had no former definition.

This chapter is still a work in progress as the language as the language is still evolving and being refined. New Sections will be added as the language develops.

## History

As an island nation, cut off from the world for centuries, much of their vocabulary was feline-related with the only major difference being the Northern and Southern dialects. Akina saw a gradual evolution, borrowing and adapting new words into it's language, during the Great War as it Nethington saw a large influx of refugees.
