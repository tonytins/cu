# Catsinburg

Catsinburg is the former capital city of Nethington, having been replaced by Furtropolis. The city was created during the Bradford kingdom's formation, and is located more inland compared to it's successor. It fell out of favor following the end of the Great War, when the country ended it's isolationist rule, and more emphases on international trade as the war greatly depleted their resources.

## Economy

The city is not nearly as diverse as it's successor, consisting only of varies feline species and breeds. Despite this set back, it used this to it's advantage and specialized in feline-oriented goods and services from which Furtropolis frequently imports from.
