# Fashion

With the exception of hairless animals, the majority of furries don't wear clothing that completely covers their body as it would irritate their fur. This means that shorter or medieval-style clothing remain the norm, despite taking place in modern to contemporary times.

## Differences

- Men's bottoms may consist of loincloths, kilts or shorts.
- Women don't need to wear pants.

### Both Genders

- Tunics.
- Short or Sleeveless tops.

### Exceptions

But full body clothing have not completely gone away. They're still used on rare or less common occasions, such as when protection outweighs comfort. E.g. construction, hazard areas, certain contact sports and weather.

## Regional

### Catsinburg

Having been around the longest, Catsinbrug's fashion is more "traditional" style.
