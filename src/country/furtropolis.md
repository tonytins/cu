## Economy

Furtropolis is home to a diverse range of species, both organic and synthetic alike, though it doesn't necessarily specialize in any one particular thing for one particular species, compared to it's predecessor, Catsinburg, but provide a healthy mix for all instead while it primarily serves as a international trading hub, due to it's ports to the ocean.

### Central Tower

Consisting of Town Hall and Mayor's House, the Central Tower sits within the city center, near parliament, museum, and historical monuments. Being the hub of the city's local politics, it also serves as the terminal for the Furtropolis subway network with shuttles to and from Grand Central Terminal.

### Grand Central Terminal

Grand Central Terminal is a railroad terminal that connects regional and long distance trains between Furtropolis and other parts of Nethington. It has transfers to the city's bus and subway network, respectfully. Some long distance trains pass under the subway with some tunnels having maintenance stairways to the above network.

### North Pacific Ports

The North Pacific Ports sees frequent trade from cargo ships and is a major cruise ship destination for tourists wishing to the view city during the summer. Cruise ships dock and sail out from Furtropolis during the winter.
