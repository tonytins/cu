Furtropolis is the capital city of Nethington that took Catsinburg's place at the end of the Great War. The city center is home to many political buildings, such as parliament, though the Bradford castle is located elsewhere.

## Economy

Furtropolis is home to a diverse range of species, both organic and synthetic alike, though it doesn't necessarily specialize in any one particular thing for one particular species, compared to it's predecessor, Catsinburg, but provide a healthy mix for all instead while it primarily serves as a international trading hub, due to it's ports to the ocean.

## Locations

### Central Tower

Consisting of Town Hall and Mayor's House, the Central Tower sits within the city center, near parliament, museum, and historical monuments. Being the hub of the city's local politics, it also serves as the terminal for the Furtropolis subway network with shuttles to and from Grand Central Terminal.

### Grand Central Terminal

Grand Central Terminal is a railroad terminal that connects regional and long distance trains between Furtropolis and other parts of Nethington. It has transfers to the city's bus and subway network, respectfully. Some long distance trains pass under the subway with some tunnels having maintenance stairways to the above network.

### North Pacific Ports

The North Pacific Ports sees frequent trade from cargo ships. It is also a major cruising destination for tourists wishing to the see city during the summer while cruise ships dock and sail out from Furtropolis during the winter. However, the ports are most known for providing a relationship with undersea creatures, who visit Nethington more often since Furtropolis.

## Alternative Universes

### Original series

In the original series, there was no kingdom or island of any kind. Furtropolis was one of many small city-states out in the middle of a barren desert. It had giant, tall and thick walls in order to block any dust storms and protect against any attacks. The Central Tower had Grand Central Terminal beneath it in order to save on space and provided extra stability for the tower above. Mice lived under and helped maintained the subway network below.
