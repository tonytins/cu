## Architecture

Ashelor is unique to those on land because it's architecture remains in the space-age (think Jetsons) with a larger and open design. This is because aquatic creatures can freely swim vertically. Despite similarities, Ashelor's designs predate the trend and are functionality different. However, the trend did help lead to it's modern design.
