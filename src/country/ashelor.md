# Ashelor

Located off the coast of Furtropolis, near the North Pacific Ports, is Ashelor, an underwater city home to varies marine creatures. Like it's neighbor, Ashelor is best known for it's international trade and tourism as well as sharing a similar economy.

## Architecture

Ashelor is unique to those on land because it's architecture remains in the space-age (think Jetsons) with a larger and open design. This is because marine creatures can freely swim vertically. Despite similarities, Ashelor's designs predate the trend and are functionality different; however, it did help inspire it's modern design.

## Culture

While the city is technically part of the Bradford kingdom, Ashelor's culture naturally differs from it's land counterpart.

### Fashion

Drawing anthropomorphic marine creatures is tricky when it comes to legs. If they have legs, their clothing is similar to the rest of Nethington but more lighter weight, loose and made of same fabric as swimsuits.
### Sports

Ashelor's primary sport derives from Final Fantasy X's [Blitzball](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Blitzball#The_sport). It's like football (as in soccer) but underwater. Major differences between Blitzball is that players are a large spherical cage instead of floating spherical water and circular goals replacing the triangular ones.

Otherwise, shares similar rules to FFX:

- Eight players per team: three fielders, four defenders, one goalkeeper.
- Team with the highest score in the second period wins.
- If a team leads by seven goals, they win.
- If two teams are tied at the end, the game goes into overtime.
