# Nethington

Public transit is the most dominant form of transport in all of Nethington. The need for it became even more demanding after the demolishing of the isolationist policy. Trains, both intercity and subways, is the most common type of transport throughout the country, making up the bulk ridership with buses coming in second. However, cars are still used for travel between rural areas, or direct connections within cities.

## Areas

## Culture
### Fashion

With the exception of hairless animals, the majority of furries don't wear clothing that completely covers their body as it would irritate their fur. This means that shorter or medieval-style clothing remain the norm, despite taking place in modern to contemporary times.

- Men's bottoms may consist of loincloths, kilts or shorts.
- Women don't need to wear pants.
- Both Genders:
  - Tunics.
  - Short or Sleeveless tops.

But full body clothing have not completely gone away. They're still used on rare or less common occasions, such as when protection outweighs comfort. E.g. construction, hazard areas, certain contact sports and weather.
